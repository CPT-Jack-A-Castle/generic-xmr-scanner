## Config files

There are two basic files for configuration of the scanner.

#### default_addresses.json 

Contains the list of addresses and the corresponding viewkeys to be used by the 
frontend as a default set. 


#### config.json

Other configuration data. Most importantly it has `scanning_from` member
which specifies how many past blocks is allowed to be scanned.
